# BTreesForDays

Project was done for bonus marks in a database impelementation course... It is not a fully functional B+ tree and is left with a lot of bugs. 

Why so many bugs?
"Big bang development" approach that was taken. Project was left last minute and quickly did something in an attempt to get some marks...
